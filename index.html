  <h1>Christian Parker</h1>
  <p>
    I am an experienced professional with personable communicative abilities, great collaborative experiences, and creative problem-solving skills. No matter what the job, I have found a knack for integrating technology, art and project management into everything and feel as if web development was a natural progression for the next chapter of my life. Iâ€™m looking for an employment opportunity where I can add value by meshing my skill set into an organization that fosters personal and professional growth.
